Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and lethal subtype of cancer. Due to high intratumour heterogeneity (ITH) and infiltrative potential, no effective cure exists. Therefore, understanding the cellular dynamics that underlie these characteristics is important in driving therapeutic discovery. 

The prognostic signalling pathways that drive disease progression and chemoresistance also directly regulates cell geometry and motility. Therefore, this thesis takes a top-down approach by adopting shape and migration potential as a readout for its invasive potential. We first present both anchor-based and anchor-free instance segmentation models that achieves state-of-the-art performance on our dataset. Downstream shape analysis show that hypoxic conditions drive phenotypic transition into mesenchymal and amoeboid forms that drive invasion and proliferation respecitvely. We highlight that hypoxic conditions drive coordinated behaviour through bursts in ITH, which could potentially be mediated through the formation of pre-mature synpases.
